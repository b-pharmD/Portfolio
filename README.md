# Portfolio

## Link to Deployed Page

https://b-pharmd.github.io/Portfolio/

## Description
I created this webpage to create a portfolio using HTML and CSS. It has an about me section, links to some of my projets, and other links. By building this I was able to learn and practice using HTML and CSS.

## Usage

The links in the navbar can be used to navigate to the corresponding sections on the page. The images can be clicked to navigate to the projects and webpages they are linked to.

## Credits
First of all, a huge shout-out to Jaytee Padilla who helped me guide me in the right direction in a tutoring session to get my HTML restructured. It was truly a mess.

I used the following free stock images:
